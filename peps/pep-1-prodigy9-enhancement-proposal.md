# PEP #1 - PRODIGY9 Enhancement Proposal

## <mark style="color:purple;">Motivation</mark>

In any company, especially startups, the executive team is the biggest single point of failure in the company. Compounding this with the fact that Software Houses grow mostly by increasing the number of Software People employed. This puts the executive team, and managers, on a management Ivory Tower very quickly. The faster the company grows, the higher the Ivory Tower becomes.

The natural remedy to this is the Corporate Hierarchy and its legions of middle managers. This is what kills the spirit of cooperation. Command-and-Control and KPIs are now mandatory because, well, otherwise we have no means to quell the managers' anxieties. The higher you go, the lonelier and more stressful it becomes.

A completely flat organization does not work very well, either. Because in reality, there is almost always something, some hard constraint, that are still very hierarchical. When the survival of the company is at stake, the executive team may be required to make very hard decisions, most likely behind closed doors. Sometimes there are issues which are impossible to get consensus on and are subsequently ignored. Some issues are just too hard and require too much political effort to convince everyone.

PEPs and RFCs seems like a good middle ground where we can have open participation and transparency and still have some form of structure so that any company issue may be addressed in a predictable and efficient way.
